# üß† Design Patterns & SOLID Principles

This repository contains practical implementations of **SOLID principles** and **object-oriented design patterns**, written in multiple programming languages:

- **Java**
- **C#**
- **TypeScript**
- **Go**

The goal is to provide a clear, multi-language reference for understanding and applying best practices in software design.

## üîë SOLID Principles

**SOLID** is an acronym for five fundamental object-oriented design principles:

### 1. **S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
A class should have **only one reason to change**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Each class should focus on a single responsibility.

### 2. **O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
Software entities should be **open for extension but closed for modification**.  
‚û°Ô∏è You can extend behavior without altering existing code.

### 3. **L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
Subtypes must be **substitutable** for their base types without breaking the application.  
‚û°Ô∏è Derived classes should honor the contracts of their base classes.

### 4. **I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.  
‚û°Ô∏è Prefer small, specific interfaces over large, general ones.

### 5. **D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on **abstractions**.  
‚û°Ô∏è Rely on interfaces, not concrete implementations.

## üß© Design Patterns

Design patterns are **general solutions to common software design problems**. They are typically categorized into three types:

### üîß 1. **Creational Patterns**
Concerned with object creation mechanisms:
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method**: Delegates object creation to subclasses.
- **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related objects.
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step.
- **Prototype**: Clones existing objects.

### üß± 2. **Structural Patterns**
Deal with object composition and relationships:
- **Adapter**: Converts one interface into another.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior without modifying the object.
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Proxy**: Controls access to another object.

### ü§ù 3. **Behavioral Patterns**
Focus on communication between objects:
- **Observer**: Notifies multiple objects of state changes.
- **Strategy**: Enables dynamic selection of algorithms.
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects.
- **State**: Changes object behavior based on internal state.
- **Template Method**: Defines the program skeleton in a base class.
